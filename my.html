            <p id="content-para">
                Early in the 20th century, birding (the practice of observing wild birds) grew in popularity. Early
                cameras were slow and cumbersome, so good photos of live birds were harder to get than other nature
                photography subjects. Most birders were just watchers of bird behavior. Even with the introduction of
                autofocus in the 1980s, the cost of telephoto lenses and film made bird photography too expensive for
                most budding nature photographers.


                These days, most digital cameras have fast and accurate autofocus systems and shutter speeds of less
                than a thousandth of a second. That speed, paired with the greater ISO capabilities, means more bird
                photographers can capture sharp images of birds in motion. Add burst mode (taking several photos in
                quick succession) and freedom from expensive film costs, and you can take hundreds of free photos in
                your quest for that one perfect shot.

            <p class="head-equipments-para">
                It's possible to get quality shots of birds on any digital camera, but these are what professionals
                recommend for the best results.
            </p>

            <h4 class="heads-equipments">
                Cameras
            </h4>

            <p class="heads-equipments-para">
                Your camera body can be DSLR or mirrorless, but it must be able to achieve a shutter speed of 1/2000 of
                a second or faster. At that speed, you might even be able to capture a hummingbird's wings without
                motion blur.



                Just as important is focus acquisition — the speed at which the motors in your camera and lens focus on
                your subject. The faster you can take multiple pictures, the more likely you are to get one that
                captures your subject the way you want. It helps to have a camera with a burst mode that can shoot six
                to nine frames per second (FPS) and that has a big enough buffer to handle large bursts before the
                camera has to pause shooting.
            </p>


            <h4 class="heads-equipments">
                Lenses
            </h4>
            <p class="heads-equipments-para">

                Long lenses can be expensive and heavy, but in order to get crisp, close-up photos, you need a long
                focal length. You can increase your focal length with a teleconverter, a secondary lens mounted between
                the camera body and another lens.



                For his bird photos, wildlife and landscape photographer Joseph Filer uses a DSLR camera with an 800mm
                lens. Photographer Gerrit Vyn says you need both long focal length and close proximity to the bird. “To
                get a full-frame hawk from 60 feet away, you need a 500mm lens and a 1.4x teleconverter,” Vyn notes. “To
                get a warbler that's five or six inches long, you need to be 15 feet away from it.”
            </p>


            <h4 class="heads-equipments">
                ISO
            </h4>
            <p class="heads-equipments-para">

                The ISO setting determines the amount of light your camera sensor takes in. For portraiture (photos of
                birds standing still), you can use a lower ISO setting, like ISO 400, and slow down your shutter speed
                to capture as much detail as possible. For birds in motion, you can go up to ISO 800 or more, high
                enough to receive a lot of light in a tiny fraction of a second. “If I am waiting for behavior, I am at
                a
                higher ISO and faster shutter speed, prepared for that moment,” says Vyn.

            </p>

            <h4 class="heads-equipments">
                Aperture
            </h4>
            <p class="heads-equipments-para">

                Aperture describes the opening in the lens that allows light to pass through to the camera's sensor,
                measured in f-stops. (Remember, the lower the f-stop number, the larger the opening.) Aperture priority
                mode is a camera setting (A or Av on the camera dial) that you can use to set the aperture manually, and
                your camera will automatically select the optimal shutter speed to match it. If the camera senses too
                much light, it will increase the shutter speed.


            </p>

            <h4 class="heads-equipments">
                Tripod
            </h4>

            <p class="heads-equipments-para">

                If you want photographs of birds perched, sitting in nests, or standing in water, you can get better
                photos with a tripod. The extra steadiness allows you to slow the shutter speed and increase depth of
                field. “It's more fun not to use the tripod and move around,” Filer says, “but if it's a portrait you
                want, then it makes sense.”



                If you want to capture flying birds or birds moving quickly on the ground, camera stabilization is key,
                but a tripod may be too unwieldy. With a lighter 200-500mm telephoto zoom lens and a fast shutter speed,
                you may be able to get good photos without the tripod.

                For the best image quality, consider the following advice before you dive into a bird photoshoot.

                <div class="tips-list-para">
                    Whether common birds or rare species are your goal, research the birds you hope to photograph. You
                    can
                    find
                    affordable field guides that will tell you where to find the birds and when they’re most colorful
                    for
                    mating
                    season. Then scout your location. “I haven’t had many trips where I was shooting landscapes and then
                    said, ‘Oh,
                    there’s an animal, I’ll go shoot it,’” says Filer. “It just doesn’t work that way. You have to
                    target.”



                    Filer recommends starting at beaches or wildlife refuges or taking a photography workshop that has
                    photography
                    blinds set up for you. Blinds are tents or more permanent structures that shield the photographer
                    from
                    the
                    animal’s view.</div>


                <li class="tips-lists">
                    Adapt to the bird’s habitat.
                </li>
                <div class="tips-list-para">

                    How you set up depends on the birds you want to shoot and how tolerant they are of human proximity.
                    “If
                    you want
                    to photograph a marsh wren, you can sit in the cattails, and they’ll eventually perch somewhere
                    close to
                    you,”
                    Vyn says.



                    For backyard birds, you might set up bird feeders near some natural perches and wait in a blind for
                    the
                    birds to
                    perch. For ducks, you can sit at the edge of a pond in a blind or other form of camouflage, and then
                    wait. “It
                    all depends on the habitat, species, and time of year, so the comprehensive knowledge of bird life
                    exponentially
                    improves your ability to find birds, get close, and get the images you’re imagining,” Vyn says.
                </div>

                <li class="tips-lists">
                    Go early or late.
                </li>
                <div class="tips-list-para">

                    Don’t shoot in the middle of the day. “You’ve got to be out there early morning or late afternoon
                    with
                    those low
                    soft sun angles,” Filer says. If you try to photograph a white bird in the middle of the day, there
                    won’t be
                    enough contrast between the bird’s feathers and the sky.
